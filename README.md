In many countries, a CV is usually the first document that a prospective employer looks at when screening candidates for job interviews, scholarship programs, grant applications, or bursaries. When sending a curriculum vitae and other application documents to the employer, some applicants may choose to send physical copies of the document through registered mail, or electronically through email, depending on what the prospective employer indicated on the job advertisement.
